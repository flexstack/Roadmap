# Deploy hooks

## Introduction

Deploy hooks allow you to run custom scripts before or after a deployment. This can be useful for tasks 
like running database migrations, clearing caches, or sending notifications.

Deploy hooks will be configurable on a per-environment basis, allowing you to run different 
scripts depending on the environment.
