# Event listeners

## Introduction

Event listeners allow you to listen to events from EventBridge and trigger ECS tasks. 
This feature is useful for running background jobs, sending notifications, and more
in response to events in your system.

Events can be triggered by your own application, AWS services, or third-party SaaS services.
